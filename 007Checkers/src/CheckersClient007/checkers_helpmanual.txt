	<p>
		Welcome to the Operation Checkers 007 help manual. 
		This document is designed to describe and explain all the functionality that Operation Checkers 007 has to offer.<br>
	</p>
	<br>
	<font size = 5><u>Table of Contents</u></font><br>

	<font size = 4><b>1. Logging In</b></font><br>
	<p>
		To log into Operation Checkers 007, start Operation Checkers 007. The login screen should appear.
		Type in the name you would like to use while playing Operation Checkers 007.
		The name cannot have any white spaces in it. In the IP text-box, type in the WSU Checkers Server
		IP address and press the connect button. You should be logged into the lobby if the name and IP
		provided are valid.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>2. The Lobby</b></font><br>
	<p>
		The lobby allows you to chat with other users, see what other users are in the lobby, see what tables
		are on the WSU Checkers Server, and interact with these tables. To see how to use the chat, see our section
		about about chat. Selecting a table from the table list will display the game description. The game description
		includes the table ID and who is in the game. To create, join, or observe a game, see the Create a Game, Joining 
		a Game, and Observing a Game sections.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>3. Creating a Game</b></font><br>
	<p>
		To create a game, make sure you are in the Lobby and hit the "Create Game" button, located in the upper-left button menu.
		This will create a table with a new, randomly generated ID and place you on the table. Creating a game will cause
		you to leave the lobby. Note that creating a game is not starting a game. To see how starting a game works, see the
		Starting a Game section.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>4. Joining a Game</b></font><br>
	<p>
		To join a game, make sure you are in the Lobby. Select the table ID from the table ID list that you wish to
		join. After Operation Checkers 007 loads the game's description and/or status, the Join Button, located in
		the upper-left button area, should become enabled if the game is capable of having one more player. You can only
		join games that have 0 or 1 player and cannot join a game that is already started.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>5. Observing a Game</b></font><br>
	<p>
		To observe a game, make sure you are in the Lobby. Select the table ID from the table ID list that you wish to
		observe. After Operation Checkers 007 loads the game's description and/or status, the Observe Button, located in
		the upper-left button area, should become enabled if the game is capable of being observed. You can only observe games
		that have two players on the table. Any amount of games can be observed at any time. You cannot observe your own game or
		the same game twice, however. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>6. Starting a Game</b></font><br>
	<p>
		After you are on a game table, the game can be started once both players have indicated they are ready to play by hitting the 
		Ready button located at the top of the table screen. Once both players have hit ready, the game will start. System messages 
		should indicate who goes first and what color you are playing as.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>7. Playing a Game</b></font><br>
	<p>
		After the game has started, each player may begin making moves when it is their turn. System messages will indicate when it is 
		your turn. To make a move, click on the piece you wish to move and then click on the space you wish to move the piece. If it is
		a valid move, the board will update and it will be the other player's turn. This version of checkers does not allow jumping
		multiple pieces at a time. A piece can move backwards once it reaches the furthest wall on the opponents side of the board.
		Once the last piece has been jumped, the game ends and who won is indicated in a pop-up. If either player disconnects or returns 
		to the Lobby during the game, the other player wins. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>8. Chat</b></font><br>
	<p>
		The chat panel is located on the bottom half of the screen in lobby and at a table. Messages received are displayed in
		the larger box on top. To send a message, type in the smaller box on the bottom and hit send. If you have the global
		radio button selected, the message will send to all players capable of receiving global messages. If you have the PM
		global radio button selected, your messages will be sent as a Private Message to whomever's name you have typed in the
		text-box next to the PM radio button. A Private Message is indicated by [PM] being next to the person's message in chat. 
		All messages received will also have a time-stamp  (24-hour-clock) next to the message, based on your computer's current time.
		You cannot send or receive global messages while you are at a table. You cannot 
		send or receive Private Messages while you are observing any game, to prevent cheating. System messages will also displayed
		through the receiving chat box. System messages are used to indicate various information to you, such as when you have joined 
		or left the lobby.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<font size = 4><b>9. Customizing Board Colors</b></font><br>
	<p>
		To customize the two colors of your checkers board, select the Customize button in the toolbar at the top of the screen. A dropdown
		selection will appear, allowing you to choose which color you would like to change. After selecting what you would like to change, a
		pop-up titled, "Choose a Color" will appear. There are five different styles for customizing a color: swatches, HSV, HSL, RGB, and 
		CMYK. Select the style you like, and then use it to create the color of your preference. Once you are satisified, hit the Ok button 
		located at the bottom of the pop-up. If you decide not to change the color, hit the Cancel button at the bottom of the pop-up. This color
		applies to your tables and games that you are observing. This customization will be reset after you close Operation Checkers 007.
